_Hello!_ I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Sciences at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/). I work in the [MadS&P Laboratory](https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/) and am advised by [Prof. Patrick McDaniel](http://patrickmcdaniel.org). 


My research is centered around evaluating and advancing the security of machine learning models, with a primary focus on adversarial robustness. This entails understanding, designing, and defending against sophisticated attacks that expose worst-case failures of machine learning models. Such attacks not only test the resiliency of machine learning models, but also highlight discrepancies between human and machine perception. My current work aims to explain and bridge this gap to build safer, better aligned machine learning models. 

Aside from AI trustworthiness, I am also interested in and have collaborated on works broadly within security and privacy, all with the goal of identifying and protecting against threats to user privacy and security in a variety of systems.
