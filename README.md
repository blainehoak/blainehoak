_Hello!_ I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Sciences at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/). I work in the [MadS&P Laboratory](https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/) and am advised by [Prof. Patrick McDaniel](http://patrickmcdaniel.org). 


My research is centered around evaluating and advancing the trustworthiness of AI/ML systems. I am specifically interested in investigating functional differences between machine learning models and biological systems (e.g., the human visual system), and how these differences play a role in the robustness and resiliency of models. My current work aims to explain and bridge this gap to build safer, better aligned machine learning models.

Aside from AI trustworthiness, I am also interested in and have collaborated on works broadly within security and privacy, all with the goal of identifying and protecting against threats to user privacy and security in a variety of systems.
